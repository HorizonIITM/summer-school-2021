# References and Resources for GR and Cosmology


Below I list some recommended resources to start learning Special and General Relativity. 

1. **DJ Griffiths, *Introduction to Electrodynamics***

     Chapter 12 of Griffiths is an excellent starting point to start studying special relativity. If you have already learned a bit of Electromagnetism, you can check how relativity affects the Maxwell's Equations.

2. **James Hartle , *An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity***

    This is in my opinion the best GR book for undergraduates. The book uses a physics first approach with enough math to get around GR initially. 

3. **[Sean Carroll's *Lecture notes on General Relativity*](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/grnotes/)**

    If you like math and want to learn GR in a math-physics balanced way , this is a good book to start with.

4. **Anthony Zee, *Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell***

    If you like to have fun while learning GR this is a book made just for you. A Zee uses stories and very fun examples to teach relatvity. Highly recomended for beginners.

For Cosmology:

1. **A.Liddle, *An introduction to modern cosmology***

    Starting point for many cosmologists. Introduces Cosmology in Newtonian physics firs before getting into GR. 

2. **Barbara Ryden, *Introduction to Cosmology***

    Another great introductory textbook for cosmology.
